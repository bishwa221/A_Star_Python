# A-Star Graph Search Algorithm

It is a path find algorthm that reads the provided 2D points/vertices, some of them connected by edges.

It then finds the optimal(shortest) path from "start" point to the "end" points.

### Steps involved:
- samples points from free C-space (C-space here is XY plane)
- makes nodes out of those nodes.
- writes the nodes into nodes1.csv file for sampling
- writes the nodes into nodes.csv file for A-star
- makes edges from nodes
- writes the edges into edges1.csv file for sampling
- writes the edges into edgess.csv file for A-star 
 - returns path.csv file
